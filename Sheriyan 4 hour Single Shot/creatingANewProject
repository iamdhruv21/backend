Creating a project Manually

1. npm init -y --> this will create package.json file
2. install all dependencies/Packages like express, mongoose, ejs and any other --> npm i express
3. create app.js file ready to go
4. to run a file --> node fileName    using this we have to run the server again and again so instead of this we use
5. npx nodemon fileName     this command.
6. Or we can make our own command By adding "start": "npx nodemon app.js" this in the Script section of the package.json file
   after this we can run simply by running --> npm start
